// Name: Brian Caguana
// Assignment 4
// Program: mult_table.cpp
// Description: Generates a multiplication table (1 to 10) for a user-entered integer.

#include <iostream> // Hey C++, hand me the input/output tools so we can chat with the user

using namespace std; // A nice shortcut so we don't have to keep typing std:: over and over

int main() { // Alright, this is where our program officially kicks off
    int num; // Setting up an empty box named 'num' to remember whatever number the user types

    cout << "Enter a number: "; // Printing a friendly prompt on the screen asking for a number
    cin >> num; // Pausing right here to grab and save whatever number the user punches in

    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) { // Starting a loop that counts smoothly from 1 up to 10
        cout << num << " x " << i << " = " << (num * i) << endl; // Doing the math on the fly and printing out each row of the table
    } // Closing out our counting loop

    return 0; // Telling the system everything went smooth with zero errors
} // And we're all done, closing out the main program
